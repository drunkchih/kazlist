      <h1>Welcome to School Board App!</h1>

      <p>Welcome to Kazlist! The main goal of this app is having a small and safe system helping parents and students.</p>
      <p>This App is a web app helping students to be successful in school and simplify the life of parents by allowing them to sign up for activities and services such as tutors (for any discipline if available) or transportation services. </p>
      <p>For example one is willing to pick up other students on his way to school, as a result he/she can offer such service and parents can sign their children to it.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that not ANYONE will be allowed to offer services. Only those interviewed or trusted by the school and parent will be given such privilege. </p>
